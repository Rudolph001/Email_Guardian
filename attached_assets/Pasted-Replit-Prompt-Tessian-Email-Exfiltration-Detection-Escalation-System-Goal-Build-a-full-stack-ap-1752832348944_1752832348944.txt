Replit Prompt: Tessian Email Exfiltration Detection & Escalation System
Goal: Build a full-stack app to ingest Tessian email CSV exports, dynamically use column names from the import, detect possible data exfiltration, and manage/track escalations via Outlook.
________________________________________
✅ Core Workflow:
1.	📥 CSV Import
o	Upload a CSV file containing Tessian email data
o	First row is treated as the header
o	Store the structured data for processing
o	All dashboard tables, filters, and field selection menus auto-generate from these headers
2.	🚫 Whitelist Domain Filtering
o	Load a trusted domain list
o	Filter out all emails with recipients/senders in the whitelist
o	Use the domain from relevant field (e.g., recipient_email, sender_domain) based on CSV headers
3.	🔎 Dynamic Filtering
o	Filters auto-adapt based on imported fields
o	User can select:
	Emails with/without attachments (based on has_attachments or similar field)
	Wordlist matches in subject or attachment name (based on column names like subject, attachment_name)
	Specific policies (e.g., policy_name, if present)
	Any other field in the import for ad hoc filters
4.	🌐 Domain Classification
o	Analyze domains (sender/recipient) and assign risk level:
	Trusted, Corporate, Personal, Public, Suspicious
o	Use classified domain as an ML input and UI label
5.	🧠 Machine Learning Classification
o	Use domain type, keywords, policy, time of email, etc., to predict exfiltration risk
o	Model categorizes emails into:
	Critical, High, Medium, Low
o	Focus is on detecting:
	Personal data (IDs, contact info)
	Business-sensitive data (client info, pricing)
	Intellectual property (internal docs, source code)
6.	💾 Save Processed Data
o	Filtered + classified dataset saved to JSON
o	JSON includes:
	Original fields
	Domain classification
	ML label
	Case state (cleared, escalated)
7.	📁 Case Management UI
o	Dashboard shows all filtered/classified email records
o	All table columns are based on CSV headers
o	Each row includes actions:
	Clear
	Escalate
8.	🚨 Escalation Handling
o	Escalated items are stored separately
o	System generates a draft Outlook email
	Populated with data from the email record
	Manual review and send by analyst
	Email body includes: user, subject, attachment name(s), risk reason
9.	⚙️ Admin Controls
o	Load/edit:
	Whitelisted domains
	Wordlists (subject/attachment match)
	Domain reputation labels
	Policies
